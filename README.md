Book Finder App
Project Overview
This project is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It serves as a book search engine that leverages the Open Library Search API. The app is designed to be clean, modern, and fully responsive, providing a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The application showcases a solid understanding of fundamental front-end development principles, including:

Component-Based Architecture: The UI is built with reusable React components.

State Management: Uses the native React Context API to manage global state.

Data Fetching: Integrates with a public API to fetch and display dynamic data.

Routing: Utilizes react-router-dom for client-side navigation.

Styling: The design is implemented using plain CSS for a custom aesthetic.

Features
Dynamic Book Search: Users can search for books by title, author, or a combination of both.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on any device.

Book Details Page: Clicking on a book card navigates to a dedicated page with more information about the selected book.

Loading State: A visual loading indicator is displayed while the application fetches data from the API.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles API errors or cases where no search results are found.

Placeholder Images: Displays a "Cover Not Available" placeholder image for books without a cover.

Technology Stack
Framework: React

Routing: react-router-dom

State Management: React Context API

API Client: Native fetch API

Styling: Custom CSS

API: Open Library Search API
